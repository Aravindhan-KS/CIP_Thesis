This powerful data processing pipeline established a cornerstone. We successfully converted raw, heterogeneous battery data into a standardized, clean, and feature-rich dataset. These multi-scale temporal features now prepare for the next phase of this project: the development and training of Quantum Machine Learning models for predictive analytics, with the main focus on early detection and understanding of battery dendrite formation to enhance battery safety, life, and performance. Feature vectors generated at this step are the required input for advanced machine learning algorithms and allow the study of subtle signatures of degradation that might indicate dendrite growth.
